Start Your Bot
====================

All set up! With the bot created and deployed, it's time to start the bot. Follow these basic steps:

1. Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor.
2. Navigate to the **i18n** folder and then access the **en** and **hn** files.
3. Update the welcome message as required and save the changes. Don't forget to push the updated code to your repository.
4. Access your AWS terminal, pull the latest changes from the repository, and restart the machine if necessary.
5. Open the bot interface and send the message **hi**. The bot should respond with a welcome message.
