Vector Databases
===================

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to efficiently store and retrieve high-dimensional vector data. These databases are particularly well-suited for applications that require complex data structures, such as natural language understanding, recommendation systems, and image recognition. Unlike traditional relational databases, which struggle with high-dimensional data, vector databases excel at handling vectors with thousands or even millions of dimensions. They enable developers to perform fast and accurate similarity searches, making them indispensable tools for building intelligent and personalized applications.
