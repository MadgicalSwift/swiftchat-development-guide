Creating Your First Chatbot
====================
To begin utilizing the starter kit, you'll need to obtain a Chatbot ID. You can create a chatbot either manually or via API.

Creating a Bot Using the SwiftChat API
------------------------
The SwiftChat APIs act as the conduit between your chatbot and yourself, processing your data accordingly. 

You can employ any tool or platform to interact with the SwiftChat APIs. In this instance, we'll demonstrate using **Postman**.

### Steps:
1. Open `SwiftChat APIs Documentation <https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/20587790/UyrGCuhH#intro>`_
2. Click on **Run In Postman**. This will provide you with two options: Postman for web and Postman for ubuntu.

4. After logging in, you'll be presented with a page where you need to select a workspace to save the SwiftChat APIs.
