User Interaction
===========

In this guide, we'll walk you through using and customizing the starter kit code to build your own Chatbot. You'll learn about the structure of the starter kit, enabling you to make updates and manage user interactions effectively.

.. tip::
    First read about starter kit structure `here <repo_structure.html>`_

Let's start with a simple example. Suppose that when a user sends "hi", you want to display a greeting message along with two buttons for selecting their preferred language. When the user selects a language button, the language should change accordingly.

**Scenario:**

1. Display a welcome message when the user sends "hi".
2. Present two buttons for language selection.
3. Show a message for language change confirmation.
